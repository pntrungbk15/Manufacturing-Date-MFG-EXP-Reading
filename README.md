# Research and Application of YOLOv11 in Manufacturing Date (MFG/EXP) Reading

## Introduction

I conducted a research project focused on the YOLOv11 object detection model, exploring its architecture, performance, and training capabilities. My work involved implementing YOLOv11 in a practical application called "Manufacturing Date (MFG/EXP) Reading." In this project, I utilized YOLOv11 to automatically detect and extract manufacturing dates (MFG) and expiration dates (EXP) from product images, aiming to optimize warehouse management and quality control processes. This effort combines theoretical research with real-world application, reflecting my passion for computer vision and artificial intelligence.

## Background

Object detection is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to production management. YOLOv11, the latest version released in 2024, offers superior performance in fast and accurate object detection. In the "Manufacturing Date (MFG/EXP) Reading" project, I applied YOLOv11 to automate the reading of dates on products, enhancing supply chain management and quality assurance.

## Project Overview

The project encompasses:

- **Theoretical Research**: Analyzing the architecture, performance, and training process of YOLOv11.
- **Version Comparison**: Evaluating the improvements of YOLOv11 over YOLOv5.
- **Practical Application**: Implementing YOLOv11 in the "Manufacturing Date (MFG/EXP) Reading" project to detect and extract manufacturing/expiration date information from product images.

## Practical Application: Manufacturing Date (MFG/EXP) Reading

In this project, I:

- **Label Detection**: Used YOLOv11 to locate labels containing MFG/EXP information on products.
- **Information Extraction**: Integrated OCR to read and decode dates from the images.
- **Automation**: Optimized warehouse inspection processes, minimizing errors and boosting efficiency.
